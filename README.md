# Computational Archival Science (CAS) Research Network

## Workshop: Exploring data, investigating methodologies

The Workshop is organised by the National Archives’ research team on the 20th and 21st of June 2019 at The National Archives. Multi-disciplinary groups will explore and experiment with The National Archives’ collections under the leadership of experts. The main focus of the event is to unlock the black box of digital research: to understand and explore the conceptual and methodological challenges and ethical implications that the digital brings to our understanding of the record and the archival context, and to suggest new ways for archives to become more accountable, collaborative and transparent. The event encourages experimentation, collaboration, engagement and discussion between the group leaders and working groups, enabling opportunities throughout the two days to discuss how we explore the data and the decision-making involved, based on specific challenges.
